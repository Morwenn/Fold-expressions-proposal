Fold-expressions-proposal
=========================

This repository contains the different revisions of a proposal to remove some potentially
silent and harmful behaviour of the *folding expressions* mechanism proposed for inclusion
into C++17 by [N4295](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4295.html).

The following files are available:

* [N4358, Unary Folds and Empty Parameter Packs](N4358.pdf)
* [P0036, Unary Folds and Empty Parameter Packs (revision 1)](P0036.pdf)

The proposal has been accepted into C++17 and implemented in Clang 3.9.
